# sem_macro_pad
This project is based on the Adafruid MarcroPad: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040 and is a fork of https://github.com/pixelpushinfreak/key_tickler_macro_pad

It's a modification for SEM control by using key shortcuts for controlling the software.

MacroPad is extended with one of their Stemma Qt 1x4 NeoKeys: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4980, six of the Stemma Qt Rotary Encoders: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991 and one Stemma Mini I2C Gamepad (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5743)

A link for a 3D printable enclosure will be added after finishing the project.
