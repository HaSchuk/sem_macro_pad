# key_tickler_macro_pad
This project is based on the Adafruid MarcroPad: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040?gclid=CjwKCAjwr_CnBhA0EiwAci5sikVNz8DN5qJxpfzbvG5E12QpohhQ6L6yDS5HTK8BDrO_iZmVVZz1wBoCfqwQAvD_BwE
I've modified it to suit my needs; extending it with two of their Stemma Qt 1x4 NeoKeys: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4980 and three of the Stemma Qt Rotary Encoders: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991

Note that I've included a folder with the version of circuitpython .uf2 file that I used, as I made a second one of these and it seemed that there were breaking changes with the later versions of circuit python.

You can find the 3D printed enclosure I made for it on printables here: https://www.printables.com/model/578085-key-tickler-macro-pad
