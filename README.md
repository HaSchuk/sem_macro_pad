# key_tickler_macro_pad
This project is based on the Adafruid MarcroPad: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040?gclid=CjwKCAjwr_CnBhA0EiwAci5sikVNz8DN5qJxpfzbvG5E12QpohhQ6L6yDS5HTK8BDrO_iZmVVZz1wBoCfqwQAvD_BwE
I've modified it to suit my needs; extending it with two of their Stemma Qt 1x4 NeoKeys: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4980 and three of the Stemma Qt Rotary Encoders: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991
